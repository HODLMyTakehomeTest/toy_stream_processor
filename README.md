# Issues
- No dispute/resolve/cashback ID

# Assumptions
- Only deposits are allowed to be disputed
- Once a disput has been resolved/cashbacked, it can be disuted again
- Once an account is locked, no other transactions can be processed
- dispute a transaction if the that would mean the available would become negative, since we're not actually reversing the transaction
